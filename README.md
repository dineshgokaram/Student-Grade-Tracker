# Student Grade Tracker

## Overview
The **Student Grade Tracker** is a Python-based application designed to manage and analyze student grades. The program allows users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional metrics such as the letter grade. This project is perfect for educators, students, or anyone who needs a simple and efficient way to track academic performance.

## Features
- **Grade Input**: Easily input grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
- **Average Calculation**: Automatically calculate the average grade from the entered data.
- **Letter Grade Assignment**: Display the corresponding letter grade based on the average.
- **Performance Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback based on the student's performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple text-based interface for ease of use.

## How It Works
1. **Input Grades**: The user is prompted to input grades for subjects or assignments.
2. **Calculate Average**: The program calculates the average grade from the input.
3. **Determine Letter Grade**: The average grade is translated into a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).
4. **Feedback**: The program provides tailored feedback based on the student's performance.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. Run the `student_grade_tracker.py` file using Python:
   ```bash
   python student_grade_tracker.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to input grades and view the results.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: VS Code

## Key Learnings
